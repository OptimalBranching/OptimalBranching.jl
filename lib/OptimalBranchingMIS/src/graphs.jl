    removed_vertices(vertices::Vector{Int}, g::SimpleGraph, clause::Clause{N}) where N

Given a list of vertices, a graph, and a clause, this function returns a list of removed vertices. 

The `vertices` argument is a vector of integers representing the vertices to consider. 
The `g` argument is a `SimpleGraph` object representing the graph.
The `clause` argument is a `Clause` object representing a clause.

The function iterates over the `vertices` and checks if the corresponding bit in the `clause.mask` is 1. 
If it is, the vertex is added to the list of removed vertices (`rvs`). 
If the corresponding bit in the `clause.val` is also 1, the neighbors of the vertex are also added to `rvs`.

The function returns the list of removed vertices with duplicates removed.
