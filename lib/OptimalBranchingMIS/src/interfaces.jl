Calculate the size of the Maximum (Weighted) Independent Set (M(W)IS) for a given vertex-weighted graph.

### Arguments
- `g::AbstractGraph`: The graph for which the M(W)IS size is to be calculated.
- `weights::Vector`: (optional) The weights of the vertices in the graph. It's set to be UnitWeight if the graph is not weighted. Defaults to `UnitWeight(nv(g))`.

### Keyword Arguments
- `branching_strategy::BranchingStrategy`: (optional) The branching strategy to be used. Defaults to a strategy using `table_solver=TensorNetworkSolver`, `selector=MinBoundaryHighDegreeSelector(2, 6, 0)`, and `measure=D3Measure`.
- `reducer::AbstractReducer`: (optional) The reducer to be applied. Defaults to `MISReducer`.
- `show_progress::Bool`: (optional) Whether to show the progress of the branching and reduction process. Defaults to `false`.

### Returns
- An integer representing the size of the Maximum (Weighted) Independent Set for the given vertex-weighted graph.

- `show_progress::Bool`: (optional) Whether to show the progress of the branching and reduction process. Defaults to `false`.

### Returns
- A tuple `(size, count)` where `size` is the size of the Maximum (Weighted) Independent Set and `count` is the number of branches.
